    <h3>SilverCloud</h3>
    SilverCloud offers three CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) programmes
    tailored to your specific needs:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Space from Anxiety</li>
      <li>Space from Depression</li>
      <li>Space from Stress</li>
    </ul>

    Programmes consists of seven or eight modules made up of information, videos,
    quizzes and exercises. It is recommended to do one per week. The goal of each
    module is for you to take the information and techniques learned and apply
    them to their day-to-day life.

    They are flexible and be accessed from anywhere (computer, tablet, phone)
    any time of the day, including holidays.

    You need to create an account with SilverCloud. This is held outside of
    Goldsmiths and no one at the university has access to your account or can
    see how you are using it. Goldsmiths only receives general information of
    how many students are using each part of the service.
