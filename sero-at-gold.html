    <h3>SilverCloud @ Goldsmiths</h3>
    <img src="silvercloud.jpg" alt="silvercloud" align="middle">
    SilverCloud offers three CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) programmes
    tailored to your specific needs:<br>
<br>
      Space from Anxiety<br>
      Space from Depression<br>
      Space from Stress<br>
    <br>
    <div>Programmes consists of seven or eight modules made up of information, videos,
    quizzes and exercises. It is recommended to do one per week.<br>
    The goal of each module is for you to take the information and techniques learned and apply
    them to their day-to-day life.<br>

    They are flexible and be accessed from anywhere (computer, tablet, phone)
    any time of the day, including holidays.<br>
    <br>
    You need to create an account with <a href="https://gold.silvercloudhealth.com/signup"><font color="#319DA2">SilverCloud.</font></a><br>
    This is held outside of Goldsmiths and no one at the university has access to your account or can
    see how you are using it.<br>
    Goldsmiths only receives general information of how many students are using each part of the service.<br></div>
